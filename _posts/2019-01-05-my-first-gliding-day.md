So, here's how the adventure started.
Today I had my first flight on a glider. Actually, three flights all of them on a winch launch.
Unfortunately, just a few minutes each: not much lift, the weather was too stable that day.

Nevertheless, a pretty good day. An amazing day, actually: the [Wellington Gliding Club](https://soar.co.nz/){:target="_blank"} is a pretty well organised machine, and it was quite interesting to realise that, as many other gliding clubs in the world, it is entirely ran by volunteers. The members of the club rotate, covering the several roles required for a smooth gliding day.

So, how does it work? Well I booked a ["One day introduction to gliding"](http://soar.co.nz/index.php/learn-to-fly/#triallessons){:target="_blank"} a couple of weeks earlier, and was told via email to get to [Papawai, Greytown](https://goo.gl/maps/4PeeJ5SDUmdhrUbt9){:target="_blank"} on Saturday by 9:30 am. One hour and twenty minutes from Wellington: a bit far away, but totally worthy.

As soon as I get there I'm welcomed by Bryan, the president, and invited to join the briefing. 
It is interesting to realise that the gliding club is located in a cattle farm! 
Cow movements are a topic of interest, actually a NOTAM, during the briefing.

Right after that, I meet the instructor that will been with me for the whole day, explaining how the club works and, of course, flying me on the glider: Lars, from Denmark. So I follow this nice guy, who starts briefing me about safety while preparing the winch for the day. Safety is very important, I would argue the most important thing for glider pilots, so it is always the first thing that is taught, and the one that is treated with most emphasis.

Then we move close to the Launch Point, which is basically a van with a radio where the person in charge coordinates each launch, together with the pilot and the winch operator.

If you have never seen a glider take off using a winch, you have missed quite a show, my friend. The winch is attached to a big tractor, with a powerful engine, and it sits at one extreme of the runway. A car (the "cable car") takes the cable from the winch and unrolls it along the runway. On the other extreme of the runway, the gliders are aligned, waiting for the cable. When the cable car arrives, the cable is unloaded from the cable car, attached to glider, and the glider is then pulled up in the sky by the winch, like a kite.
There is a [short and nice video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrUTjWEfbcI){:target="_blank"} by Bruno Vassel that briefly explains how it works. Unfortunately it doesn't show the winch. But [this other video here does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHms8MVHm5I){:target="_blank"}.

We witness a couple of launches and I think "ok, pretty good", while Lars explains to me how a correct winch launch should be executed: keep the wings leveled, let the glider take off, pick up speed, slowly rotate into the climb, maintain the attitude, rotate out of the climb, release.

And finally it is our turn. First of all, we do a quick ABCDE (Airframe, Ballast, Controls, Dolly, Eventualities) check around the glider. The glider is a DG-1000s, two seat glider with weight ballasts in the tail. 
We adjust the ballast in the tail, ensure the tail dolly used to tow the glider around is detached, we wear the parachutes and jump into the glider.

Quite comfortable for a high performance two-seat flying machine I have to admit. We adjust the rudder pedals, strap into the four points belt, and do the pre-flights CB SIFT BEC checks.  Controls, Ballast, Straps, Instruments, Flaps Trim, Brakes, Eventualities, Canopy. If you are interested, [here](https://www.midlandgliding.club/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pre-Flight-Checks.pdf){:target="_blank"} is one of the many explanations of this checklist you can find online.

Then Lars calls "ready" on the radio, the Launch Point informs the winch about the type of glider, the winch calls back with the launch settings, then the pilot accepts, or negotiates, the settings, then the cable is hooked on, and finally the glider is launched into the sky.

The winch launch feels a bit like a roller coaster ride. During my first launch my thoughts were "well, yup, cool, but I'm not sure I will ever be able to control this thing". 
Lars seems pretty confident and the launch proceeds very smoothly. And up there we are, at about 2000 ft, and we can see Greytown, CartertonMasterton... the Ruamahanga river below us, the white orchard...

And, too soon, it's time to land... like I said at the beginning of this account, not much lift today. The landing is way smoother than the winch launch, quite encouraging for a total beginner.

We manage to get a couple of more flights during the day: no luck with lift, but the winch launch looks less and less scary, almost manageable at the end of the day.

Lars is great at explaining everything you need to know while operating on land, helping the gliding day to happen, and I am struggling a little bit to fit all that new information inside my brain.

Until, too soon, the day starts dying out - not many people care to fly since, being no lift, the only thing you can do is practice take off and landing. We get back to the hangar, clean the gliders, put them to sleep, and then to the clubhouse, where Lars signs my "Soaring Certificate" - that certifies, literaly, that "I had a successful glider flight with the WGC".
Lars reckons I had a good day; the only not-so-good thing was I couldn't experience a long-ish flight (~2 hours) because of not enough list.

"It has been a great day, all in all", I can't help to think, while driving back home. "Well, better luck next time, I guess". 

So, I decided to set my goal for 2019 will be to learn flying sail planes. 

Stay tuned.
